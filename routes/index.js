// This is where you would import all your routes
// suppose you had multiple groups of endpoints such as /api /auth etc
// you could have them stored in separate files and much like with models
// export a global object containing references to all route declarations
// It would take the following form
// module.exports = { Api, Auth } ...
// If this syntax looks a bit funny to you, look up ES6 destructuring
